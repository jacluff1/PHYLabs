Get data for FourG:
	statistal readings for A, B, AB, Neither AB
	bulb = 8
	record time where we switch between max and min settings on the micrometer

find the x axis for diffraction graphs:
	using the "angle" measurement?
	perhaps the x axis is the angle?

determine what the y axis should be on diffraction graphs:
	counts?
	volts?
	something else?
